# Brinjal

Brinjal is an engine to connect you to customers around you!

## Why?

1. 43% of all mobile searches have local intent
2. People can access anything from stars to cosmos but not the basic facilities around them 

## Ease of use - Powered by Watson

We used a couple of Watson APIs to improve the user experience we try to provide!
1. Retrieve and rank -> To generate better search results for the user queries.
2. Tone analyzer -> To detect the emotion while reviewing a 'place' 
3. Help the merchant to react and improve in the direction of the feedbacks' emotions.
